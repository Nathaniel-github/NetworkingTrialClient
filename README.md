# NetworkingTrialClient 
This is the client side to my first networking game.
Currently the code will not be able to run on its own at any time. This is because I am currently routing the traffic through  an ngrok tcp tunnel so that I can run the server code locally on my own computer. This means that in order for the client code to run I need to open the ngrok tcp tunnel and then change the source code to the updated port so that the data will be transfered to my computer which is running the server application.
